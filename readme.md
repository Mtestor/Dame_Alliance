Ceci est un projet de jeu de dame "Alliance" fait en Python avec Pygame.

To test, launch prototype.py with python 3 (you need Pygame on your computer)  
   
Click on a pawn to choose it  
Click on a to the case you want to move to move it  
Clicking on a case on which you can't move, unchoose the pawn    
If you pass on a pawn of a different color you capture it (there are nothing eat them all)
