Ceci est un projet de jeu de dame "Alliance" fait en Python avec Pygame.

To test, launch game.py with python 3 (you need Pygame on your computer)  
   
Click on a pawn to choose it  
Click on a to the case you want to move to move it  
Clicking on a case on which you can't move, unchoose the pawn    
If you pass on a pawn of a different color you capture it (there are nothing eat them all)   
Click on red square after moving to change type and end turn
Click on blue triangle to just end turn   
The circle in bottom left is indicating who play  
The game is automatically saved on the end of each turn   
If you have a save, when launched the game will use it so delete it if want to restart   
If both player have just royal pawn they can end the game by each clicking on their turn to the purple square if one don't want he can click on end turn
